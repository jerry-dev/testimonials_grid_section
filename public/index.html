                            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
                            more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                            “I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
                            make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                            I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                            shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time
                            of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
                            working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”
